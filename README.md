# Support Vector Machines
Application of SVM and LS-SVM algorithms to several problems and datasets.

## Scope
This repository contains part of the source code that was used/developed in the context of the exercise sessions of the course **Support Vector Machines** for the Master's in Artificial Intelligence, KU Leuven (2020-2021). 

***Note**: A comprehensive report showcasing the application of the various models and their insights/results is available upon request.*


## Description
The repository is comprised of the below subdirectories:
* **classification**: application of SVM and LS-SVM to classification problems
* **kpca**: application of kernel-PCA for dimensionality reduction (or increase)
* **regression**: application of SVM and LS-SVM to function estimation and time series prediction
* **spectral**: application of spectral clustering algorithm to 3D inseparable rings


## Requirements
The provided Matlab scripts require the below packages to be downloaded and imported:
* SVM
* LS-SVM

## Disclaimer
Large parts of the provided source code were originally authored by teaching assistants.
